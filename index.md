Thanks for taking the course *Statistics for Business and Economics - I*. This is the first course in the sequence of two statistics courses offered for the Business and Economics majors at EWU. In the first course (*Statistics for Business and Economics - I*), you will be introduced to the basic probability theory, some descriptive statistics and some aspects of sampling. We won't be covering Statistical Inference in this course (*I am sorry if you are sad!* :sob:). But don't
